## 📖 Description

This project is a beginner-friendly bookstore website built using only HTML and CSS. It demonstrates how to create and structure a multi-page static website while focusing on layout design, navigation, and clean user interface.

The website includes five interconnected pages:

- Home Page    
- Book Details Page  
- Buy Now Page  
- Feedback Page  

Through this project, I learned how to structure HTML effectively and style with CSS to bring a design to life. It also gave me insight into building a basic user experience from scratch.
